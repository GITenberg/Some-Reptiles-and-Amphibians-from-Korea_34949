<h1>Some Reptiles and Amphibians from Korea</h1>

<p class="center">BY<br />
ROBERT G. WEBB, J. KNOX JONES, JR., AND GEORGE W. BYERS</p>


<p>In 1954, two of us (Jones and Byers) collected reptiles and
amphibians in Korea incidental to field studies relating to hemorrhagic
fever. The 382 specimens thus obtained were deposited
either in the Museum of Natural History of The University of
Kansas (KU), or in the Museum of Zoology of the University of
Michigan (UMMZ), and are the basis for the present report. Continuous
American military operations of one sort or another in
Korea since 1945 have afforded opportunities for interested persons
to obtain there collections of amphibians and reptiles, the study
of which has resulted in several recent publications (Babb, 1955;
Dixon, 1956; Hahn, 1959 and 1960; Shannon, 1956 and 1957;
Stewart, 1953 and 1954; Tanner, 1953; Walley, 1958<i>a</i> and 1958<i>b</i>).
This paper, which contains comments on the natural history and
taxonomy of 22 species, all previously reported from Korea, supplements
earlier studies, especially Shannon's (1956) annotated list
of the herpetofauna of the country.</p>

<p>Shannon (<i>loc. cit.</i>) recorded 36 kinds of reptiles and amphibians
from Korea. Subsequently, <i>Bufo stejnegeri</i> (previously omitted)
was added by Shannon (1957), <i>Takydromus takydromoides oldi</i>
was described by Walley (1958<i>a</i>), and <i>Takydromus kwangakuensis</i>
was relegated to synonymy under <i>T. amurensis</i> by Walley
(1958<i>b</i>). Presently, then, 37 kinds are on record from the Korean
Peninsula.</p>

<p>In the accounts beyond, Jones and Byers are mostly responsible
for the remarks on natural history, whereas Webb is mostly responsible
for the taxonomic comments. The synonymies include
(1) the original description, which is followed by (2) the first use
of the name-combination here employed if it differs from the name
as originally proposed, and (3) any synonyms having type localities
in Korea. All measurements are in millimeters and all dates refer
to the year 1954 unless otherwise indicated. A gazetteer of localities
mentioned in the text and a list of literature cited follow
the accounts of species.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the officers, enlisted men and civilians associated
in 1954 with the Field Unit of the Commission on Hemor<!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>rhagic
Fever, Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, who aided our
efforts in Korea; we are especially mindful of the contributions of
Dr. Albert A. Barber, Dr. Marshall Hertig, Mr. Louis J. Lipovsky
and Dr. Warren D. Thomas. We are grateful also to Mr. Yoshinori
Imaizumi, National Science Museum of Japan, for his translations
of several papers in Japanese, and to Dr. Edward H. Taylor for
making certain pertinent references available to us.</p>


<p class="species"><b>Hynobius leechii</b> Boulenger</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Hynobius Leechii</i> Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 19:67, January,
1887 (type locality, Gensan [=Wonsan], Korea).</p>

<p><i>Hynobius leechii quelpaertensis</i> Mori, Jour. Chosen Nat. Hist. Soc., 6:47
(Japanese) and 53 (English), March 25, 1928 (type locality, Quelpart
Island [=Cheju Do], Korea).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Specimens examined</i> (3).&mdash;1 mi. SW Inje, 1 (KU); 4 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri,
Cheju Do, 2 (KU).</p>

<p><i>Description</i> (KU 38774 from 1 mi. SW Inje).&mdash;Total length, 86 (head 13,
body 40, tail 33); costal grooves (including axillary and inguinal), 13; two
costal grooves between adpressed toes; length of inner branch of series of
vomerine teeth less than distance between outer border of naris and peak of
opposite series (tooth-rows V-shaped, approximately as long as broad); dorsal
surface yellowish brown or buff (yellowish in life), having numerous blackish
marks; venter yellowish cream, having an indistinct grayish mottling.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The salamander described above was found in a foxhole
with another desiccated individual (not saved) on a military
compound on April 24. The only other occurrence of <i>H. leechii</i>
on the mainland to come to our attention was the report of several
larvae that were seen in a small pool on a hillside near Chip´o-ri
in the summer of 1953.</p>

<p>Each of the two specimens from Cheju Do (KU 38775-76) differs
from KU 38774 in having (1) the length of inner branch of the
vomerine series slightly greater than the distance between outer
border of naris and peak of opposite series (tooth-rows V-shaped,
longer than broad), (2) a dorsal and ventral keel on the tail,
(3) one costal groove (rather than two costal grooves) between
adpressed toes, and (4) in being darker both dorsally and ventrally.
The area of buff on the dorsal surface of each specimen is reduced
by a fine, blackish mottling and stippling, and the venter of each
is grayish. Respective total lengths of KU 38775 and 38776 are
84 (head 12, body 36, tail 36) and 89 (12, 35, 42), and the number
of costal grooves 13 and 14. Although the two specimens are of
approximately the same size, the tail of KU 38776 is noticeably
the longer; the tail of KU 38775 is thicker and deeper than that
of KU 38776.<!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>The two specimens from 4 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri were taken on September
9 in damp substrate under volcanic rocks along a little-used
road; although many rocks were overturned, only these two individuals
were found. A South Korean soldier informed us that
salamanders were fairly common on Cheju Do.</p>

<p>Mori (1928<i>a</i>:16) first mentioned in Japanese text the alleged
distinctiveness of the salamander occurring on Cheju Do. Later,
Mori (1928<i>b</i>:47 in Japanese, and 1928<i>c</i>:53 in English) provided
valid descriptions of the subspecies, <i>Hynobius leechii quelpaertensis</i>.
Okada (1934:17) questioned the validity of <i>H. l. quelpaertensis</i>
and Sato (1943) regarded the salamanders of Cheju Do as
inseparable from the Korean <i>H. leechii</i>. The English description
of <i>quelpaertensis</i> is briefer than the preceding one in Japanese
and lacks comparisons with related forms. KU 38775-76 seemingly
differ appreciably from the description of <i>quelpaertensis</i> only in
having the series of vomerine teeth narrowly V-shaped and longer
than broad. We tentatively follow Sato in regarding <i>quelpaertensis</i>
as a synonym of <i>leechii</i>.</p>


<p class="species"><b>Bombina orientalis</b> (Boulenger)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Bombinator orientalis</i> Boulenger, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 5:143, pl. IX,

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Specimens examined</i> (87).&mdash;2 mi. N Chip´o-ri, 8 (KU), 5 (UMMZ); 1 mi.
SW Inje, 1 (KU); 15 mi. NE Mosulp´o, Cheju Do, 6 (KU); Sangdaehwa, 2

Tangnim-ni, 2 (KU); 3 mi. SW Yanggu, 1 (KU); 2 mi. N Yongdae-ri, 8
(KU), 4 (UMMZ).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Most of our specimens were taken from breeding congresses
after heavy rains in rice fields and other shallow temporary
waters. Thirteen individuals from Chip´o-ri were collected from
foxholes around the edge of a military compound (two pairs in
amplexus; no egg masses seen), and represent a small sample of
frogs that were everywhere following a heavy rain on the night of
May 13-14. On April 23, 32 <i>Bombina orientalis</i> and three <i>Rana
temporaria dybowskii</i> were trapped in the water-filled bottom of
an unused grease pit near Tangjonggok. Many tadpoles and two
kinds of egg masses (small clusters and beadlike strings) were
present; the small clusters of <i>Bombina</i> were commonest. On June
13 at the same locality, thousands of these toads were observed
(hundreds in axillary amplexus) in foxholes, temporary rain pools,
and backwashes along the Puk-ch´on [river]. On June 12 near<!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Yongdae-ri many individuals were seen (several pairs in amplexus),
along Route 24 paralleling the Puk-ch´on, in rain pools and in
ditches and backwashes from the river; almost all available water
contained small (approximately 10 × 10 mm.) egg masses. Numbers
of eggs per mass, selected at random, were 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 8, 8, 2
and 5. Some that were saved subsequently hatched on June 15-17.</p>

<p>The call is a quiet low trill or series of staccato whistles rising
slightly at the beginning; a short peeplike note also was heard. The
specimens from Cheju Do, which are generally smaller than those
collected on the mainland in spring, were taken on September 6
in a small stream that had large volcanic rocks in many places and
that was flanked by thick brush and small trees. The earliest and
latest dates on which <i>B. orientalis</i> was collected were April 21 and
September 6, respectively.</p>

<p>In the breeding season, males are distinguished from females by
the large blackish (probably brownish earlier in season) areas on
the anteroventral surface of the antebrachium, the metacarpal
tubercle, and the inner surface of the first finger (sometimes also
the second and third). Also, males have conspicuous black-tipped
tubercles on the back (usually absent in females) that extend onto
the limbs (usually smooth in females, at least laterally). Field
observations by one of us (Byers) suggested that the dorsal pattern
of males had greater contrast than that of females and that
the venter was brighter reddish. Eight females from Tangjonggok
averaged 47.9 (43-51) in snout-vent length, whereas 24 males
from there averaged 50.0 (46-55), indicating little, if any, size
difference between the sexes.</p>

<p>Okada (1931:29) recorded variation in color of live Korean
individuals (green or brown dorsally and pale yellow or red ventrally)
and variation in extent of black markings on the belly (<i>op.
cit.</i>:fig. 12). The specimens from Cheju Do (28, 32, 32, 32, 37
and 46 in snout-vent length) have less black ventrally than specimens
from the mainland.</p>

6 mi. E Seoul, 4 (KU), 2 (UMMZ); 1 mi. S Yami-ri, 1 (KU).</p>

<p><i>Description (nine females).</i>&mdash;Dorsal surface brownish, having indistinct
pale areas, some of which tend to form longitudinal stripes that extend pos<!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>teriorly
from parotoid glands; blackish mark, usually on lateral part of parotoid,
having short spurs directed posteriorly and ventrally; edge of upper jaw and
warts on dorsal surface becoming blackish with increasing size; small, conspicuous
group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoid; middorsal warts
tending, at level of posterior edge of parotoids, to form a V that has its apex
between the parotoids; ventral surface pale yellowish, sometimes having well-defined
blackish marks; granular underparts of large specimens having small
blackish tubercles.</p>

<p><i>Male (KU 40118 from 5 mi. E Seoul).</i>&mdash;Snout-vent length, 65; no vocal
sacs or slits; dorsal and inner surfaces of first and second fingers, and inner
surface of third finger black; canthus rostralis indistinct (a well-defined ridge
on right side); nostrils closer to tip of snout than to eye, their distance from
each other slightly less than interorbital width; interorbital width (6.2)
greater than width of eyelid (4.7); tympanum distinct, circular, its diameter
(3.0) less than length of eye (6.5), and approximately twice distance (1.6)
of tympanum from eye; no cranial crests; parotoid gland elongate, approximately
twice as long as broad (12.5 × 5.0), narrowly separated from posterior
edge of eyelid; head elongate (width at posterior edge of tympanum, 23.6);
length from posterior edge of tympanum to tip of upper jaw, 18.9; first finger
slightly longer than second, fourth finger about two-thirds as long as third;
most subarticular tubercles divided; outer palmar tubercle larger than inner;
heels not touching when folded legs placed at right angles to longitudinal
axis of body; tibiotarsal articulation just reaching eye when leg laid forward;
tarsometatarsal articulation not reaching beyond snout; foot large (tibiotarsal
articulation to tip of fourth toe approximately 46.0); fourth toe approximately
half webbed, other toes more than half webbed; edges of webs somewhat
crenulate; some subarticular tubercles divided; length of inner metatarsal
tubercle (4.5) more than half length of first toe (7.0); inner metatarsal
tubercle larger than outer, both darkened; tarsal fold extending from inner
metatarsal tubercle for approximately two-thirds length of tarsus; tips of toes
(not fingers) darkened; dorsal surface of back and proximal part of hind legs
coarsely granular, of rounded, pavement-type tubercles lacking sharp tips;
small group of warts near angle of jaw below parotoids; dorsal pattern contrasting
and irregular (especially on limbs), of dark brown and pale gray;
conspicuous black mark (interrupted) on lateral surface of parotoid having
two, well-defined spurs that project posteroventrally; undersurface granular,
lacking markings except for two indistinctly-margined dark spots on chest,
and black spot on left leg.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This nocturnal, introduced species (Okada, 1931:47)
is presumably widespread in Korea and seemingly prefers lowland
habitats. Individuals were taken in sparse vegetation on a sand
flat near the Han River, at the edge of a rice field in a light rain,
along a road at night, and in millet fields adjacent to the Han
River, which was flooding at that time (July 9).</p>

<p>As is obvious from the foregoing descriptions, the male (KU
40118), which was obtained on March 19, differs considerably from
the nine females; neither does it agree with Stejneger's (1907:66)<!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
or Okada's (<i>op. cit.</i>:45-46, fig. 18) description of males of <i>Bufo
bufo asiaticus [=gargarizans]</i> from Wonsan and Seoul. Upon
cursory examination, KU 40118 is notable for having a contrasting
dorsal pattern and elongate, ranidlike proportions. Some of the
characteristics resemble those of <i>Bufo raddei</i> Strauch as given by
Stejneger (<i>op. cit.</i>:70-72, figs. 53-57), Okada (1935:9, figs. 2 and
32-34, pls. II-III), and Liu (1950:203-205, fig. 43).</p>

<p>Stejneger (<i>op. cit.</i>:59-68) recognized <i>B. b. gargarizans</i> as occurring
in southern China, and <i>Bufo bufo asiaticus</i> as the subspecies
occurring in northern China. Subsequently, <i>asiaticus</i> was relegated
to synonymy under the earlier-named <i>gargarizans</i>&mdash;see discussions
by Pope and Boring (1940:33) and Liu (<i>op. cit.</i>:220).</p>


<p class="species"><b>Kaloula borealis</b> (Barbour)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Cacopoides borealis</i> Barbour, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 51(12):231, April,
1908 (type locality, Antung, Manchuria).</p>

<p><i>Kaloula borealis</i>, Noble, Amer. Mus. Novit., 165:6, April 16, 1925.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Specimens examined</i> (8).&mdash;5 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU); 6 mi. E Seoul, 3
(UMMZ); 7 mi. ESE Seoul, 4 (KU).</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;On April 5, one male and three females were uncovered
by a bulldozer from between one and two feet below the
surface of the ground in an old Korean burial mound; one individual
was completely surrounded by compact soil. All quickly became
active when placed in water. Two of the females (43 and 44 in
snout-vent length) contained masses of immature eggs. A male
obtained on June 4 was found during a rain; the three UMMZ
specimens were obtained on July 8 on banks above the Han River.
Breeding of this species seems to coincide with the rainy season
in late spring and early summer when males were noted calling
around flooded ditches and swales in deep grass. The local Korean

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Hylids from 5 mi. ESE Seoul were collected from a
cement-walled pit at the Seoul City Water Works; a specimen of
<i>Elaphe rufodorsata</i> taken in the pit had eaten one hylid. Two
individuals were taken in the morning of May 29 on leaf litter in a
wooded valley in the Central National Forest where a number
were calling in a light rain, but the species was rarely found in
woods. Two frogs were found along a rocky stream at Sangbonch´on-ni.
Most individuals were taken while calling, on grasses
and reeds or on the ground, along the edges of rice fields. Sixteen
hylids collected 1 mi. NW Oho-ri were calling in shallow water of
a rice field on a hillside, but none was heard in a large lake nearby
or in adjacent fields. On May 15, 4 mi. ESE Ch´orwon, approximately
one hundred tadpoles, thought to be of this species, congregated
near a drain (into a lower field) of an unused rice field;
the tadpoles were well-developed, some having hind legs. The
earliest and latest dates of collection represented in our material
are May 8 and October 29. The call is best described as a raspy
"waak," "week," or "wiick" in the middle register.</p>

<p>The listing of "Hylae arboreae var japonicae descript pars <i>Schleg.
in Fauna Japon.</i> p. 112 ..." by Günther (1858:81) in synonymy
under the account of <i>Polypedates schlegelii</i>, implies that
Schlegel was the first author to use the name-combination <i>Hyla
arborea japonica</i>. Boulenger (1882:86, 381) went so far as to credit
Schlegel as the author of the name <i>japonica</i>. The reason for this
action is not known because Schlegel (in von Siebold, 1838:112)
referred to this hylid only under the name "Hyla arborea."</p>

grasses and reeds in water along the edge of Ch´orwon Reservoir,
2 mi. S Ch´orwon, where they were difficult to find in the thick
vegetation even though their low, soft calls were heard; the specimen
from 1 mi. NW Oho-ri was found in a rice field. Otherwise,
habitats recorded indicate a preference for small, fast-flowing
streams, especially in wooded valleys. On one occasion, individuals
were found trapped in cement-walled pits about old ruins
on a wooded hillside in the Central National Forest. The earliest
and latest dates of capture among our specimens are May 15 and
November 6. In addition to the localities listed above, the species
was observed 4 mi. W Ch´ungju.</p>

<p><i>R. rugosa</i> may have an extensive breeding season as suggested
by the variation in size of frogs collected or observed in 1954. Of
nine frogs obtained on May 29, five ranged in snout-vent length
from 26 to 28, and four from 42 to 54. Three specimens collected

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Back brownish or grayish (greenish in life), having few,
indistinct or well-defined, dark blotches, or extensive blackish areas (representing
fusion of markings); pale, middorsal stripe (pale green, buff or yellowish
in life) from snout to anus, sometimes as wide as interorbital width, but
indistinct or lacking when pattern on back absent; blackish bar often present
behind tympanum; posterior surface of thigh mottled; underparts pale yellow
to whitish, sometimes having a few dusky marks on throat; longitudinal ridges
between dorsolateral folds indistinct in some small frogs; largest female and
male having respective snout-vent lengths of 100 and 70.</p></div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Rana nigromaculata</i> is the most abundant ranid in
central Korea and, in a general way, the ecological equivalent of
<i>Rana pipiens</i> in temperate North America. The species is associated
with most aquatic habitats, from rocky streams to rice fields and
large impoundments. In the vicinity of Seoul the din of large
breeding congresses was heard more or less continuously from
mid-April to mid-May. Large numbers of juveniles (approximately
one inch long) were noticed first on July 8 and were present<!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
thereafter for about three weeks, being commonest in standing
water after heavy rains or during prolonged showers. These data
and the different sizes of individuals collected at the same time
suggest either variable growth or, more probably, an extensive
breeding season. Our earliest and latest dates of collection are
April 16 and October 7. The Korean name for "frog," most often
applied to <i>R. nigromaculata</i>, sounds something like "keg-oh-ree."
The call is a prolonged, raspy, staccato croak, sometimes with a
rising inflection at the end.</p>

<p>In addition to the localities listed above, the species was observed
5 mi. W Kwangju and 3 mi. S Osan.</p>

<p>Despite a high degree of individual variation, <i>Rana nigromaculata</i>
seemingly varies geographically as well; some subspecies probably
should be recognized, but the species as a whole has never been
thoroughly studied systematically. The division of <i>R. nigromaculata</i>
into three subspecies by Schmidt (1927:563-567) was considered
untenable by Fang and Chang (1931:95-98), and it has
been regarded by most recent authors as a variable, monotypic
species.</p>

<p>The named subspecies <i>R. n. chosenica</i> (Okada, 1931:89, with
type locality at Seoul, and geographically restricted to Korea) was
considered a subspecies of <i>Rana plancyi</i> by Shannon (1956:36).
The most trenchant characters of <i>plancyi</i> seem to be the wide dorsolateral
folds, the uniform greenish dorsum, the presence of dermal
pustules on the back between the dorsolateral folds, and the lack
of a mottled pattern on the posterior surface of the thigh. Among
our specimens of <i>R. nigromaculata</i>, the width of the dorsolateral
folds is variable, a uniform greenish dorsum is found only in large
males, dermal pustules are mixed with ridges in only one male
(KU 38733), and all have a spotted or mottled pattern on the
posterior surface of the thigh. All of our specimens having an
indistinct pattern on the back, or lacking a pattern, are males and
resemble the photographs of males published by Moriya (1954:
pl. I, fig. 5) and Liu (1936: pl. IV, figs. 1-2); juveniles of both
sexes and large females have contrasting patterns.</p>

<p>None of our frogs seems, therefore, clearly referable to the
species <i>plancyi</i>, although some characters are suggestive of <i>plancyi</i>.
Moriya (<i>op. cit.</i>:19), who studied variation of <i>R. nigromaculata</i> in
Japan, noted that one of the most distinct populations there (<i>R. n.
brevipoda</i>) resembled <i>Rana plancyi</i>. Ting (1939) discovered that
<i>nigromaculata</i> and <i>plancyi</i> were cross-fertile and raised hybrid<!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
larvae through metamorphosis. Pope and Boring (1940) suggested
hybridization between the two species in eastern China, and the
above mentioned facts suggest to us the possibility of hybridization
in other regions.</p>

<p><i><a name="Remarks_Rana_amurensis_coreana" id="Remarks_Rana_amurensis_coreana"></a>Remarks.</i>&mdash;One individual of <i>R. a. coreana</i> (KU 38698) and one
of <i>Rana temporaria dybowskii</i> (KU 38715) were collected on May
29 along a stream in the Central National Forest in association with
<i>R. rugosa</i> and <i>R. nigromaculata</i>. Specimens of <i>coreana</i> from the
vicinity of Seoul were found in rice fields. The earliest date of
collection was April 13 at Yongp´yong. Our largest specimen of
<i>coreana</i> measured 47 in snout-vent length.</p>

<p>Because <i>R. a. coreana</i> and <i>Rana temporaria dybowskii</i> are sympatric
in central Korea and closely resemble one another, the two
species were not distinguished in the field and the following observations
may pertain to either (or both) species. Wood frogs were
observed 2 mi. E Songdong-ni on July 12 in paddies (rice fields)
along with individuals of <i>Hyla arborea</i>, <i>Rana rugosa</i>, and <i>Rana
nigromaculata</i>. At Chip´o-ri on April 6, individuals (probably
<i>R. t. dybowskii</i>) were seen in a seepage pool from an abandoned
rice field; <i>R. nigromaculata</i> also was seen there. Six or seven egg
masses (some having small tadpoles) were observed in the shallow
water, but it was not certain to which species the eggs belonged.
Completely metamorphosed young (probably <i>R. a. coreana</i>) were
first seen 1 mi. N Oho-ri on June 9. At Taehoesan-ni on November
12, several sluggish frogs were seen in a small pool that was covered
by a thin layer of ice.</p>

<p>On September 26 in the Central National Forest, many wood
frogs of various sizes were observed. <i>R. amurensis</i> and <i>R. temporaria</i>
probably have extended breeding seasons that correspond to
those of <i>R. rugosa</i> and <i>R. nigromaculata</i>. Judging from our observations,
<i>amurensis</i> prefers the proximity of water, whereas <i>temporaria</i>
may occur some distance from permanent water.</p>

<p><!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
In our specimens, <i>R. amurensis coreana</i> differs from <i>R. temporaria
dybowskii</i> in having (1) smaller maximal size, (2) more slender
body, (3) shorter legs, (4) incompletely webbed toes, (5) no
mottling or barring on lips, (6) no contrasting barred pattern on
hind legs, (7) dark brown stripes (usually) between dorsolateral
folds, (8) a dark brown, linear mark below canthus, and (9) an
immaculate ventral surface. Two additional distinguishing characters,
which we found difficult to evaluate, are the nearly straight,
dorsolateral folds, and lack of vocal sacs or ostia in males of <i>R. a.
coreana</i> (Shannon, 1956:38). Some of the differences between
the two species were illustrated by Okada, 1931:107, fig. 48, <i>R.
temporaria temporaria</i> [=<i>R. t. dybowskii</i>] and 123, fig. 54, <i>R.

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This common, vagrant species was found on brushy
hillsides, near buildings on hills above rice fields, in tall grasses
near streams, in rice fields, and along drainage and irrigation ditches.
The earliest and latest dates of collection were April 5 and November
7. On the first date mentioned an individual was found in
hibernation with five <i>Elaphe rufodorsata</i> and one <i>Agkistrodon halys</i>
in an earthen Korean burial mound. The specimen was uncovered
by a bulldozer at a depth of about one foot below the surface. We
were told that 18 snakes of this species were found in the same
place (7 mi. ESE Seoul) the previous winter.</p>

<p>The stomach of each of four individuals contained one <i>Rana
nigromaculata</i>. The stomach of another individual contained a <i>R.
nigromaculata</i> and remains of a carabid beetle, whereas another
contained three small, partially-digested frogs that appeared to be
<i>Hyla arborea</i>. P. M. Youngman reported to us that he found a
snake of this species that was attempting to swallow a toad, <i>Bufo
bufo gargarizans</i>. One of the small individuals from Cheju Do was
being eaten by a <i>Zamenis spinalis</i> when found. One specimen was

<p>Two females of this oviparous species (lengths of body, 680 and

mm. long. A female (UMMZ 113458, length of body, 710), which
was captured on July 10 and kept alive in captivity, laid 11 eggs
on August 12 between 9 and 10 in the morning. The weight of
nine of these eggs averaged 3.32 (3.0-3.6) grams; the last two eggs
deposited were small and weighed only 1.3 and 1.4 grams. The
eggs were incubated unsuccessfully. One that was opened on
September 14 and another opened on September 26 contained

<p>Our largest female and largest male have respective total lengths
of 1013 (840 + 173) and 740 (575 + 165). Our smallest specimens,
captured on September 9, measured 215 and 230 mm. in length
of body, and probably represent young of the year. The snake
found in hibernation on April 5 measured 275 in length of body.
The ventrals of 11 males averaged 161.3 (158-171) and those of
14 females, 165.1 (160-170); subcaudals of eight males averaged
69.6 (66-74) and those of 14 females, 61.5 (52-73).</p>

<p>Males seem to have small scales in the anal region that are more
strongly keeled than scales elsewhere on the body (the scales catch
on finger tips when rubbed in a posteroanterior direction), but
males lack small tubercles on the upper and lateral parts of the
head as mentioned by Maslin (1950:433). The comments of the
same author (<i>op. cit.</i>:434) concerning integumental poison glands
in the nuchal region of this species are of interest in view of several
reports that we received of swollen extremities resulting from
handling snakes of this species.</p>

<p>In using the generic names <i>Rhabdophis</i> and <i>Amphiesma</i> for
species formerly placed in the genus <i>Natrix</i>, we follow Malnate
(1960), who divided <i>Natrix (auct.)</i> into five distinct genera.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The specimen from the Central National Forest was
captured on August 18 near a stream on a damp ground-cover of
leaves. The specimens from Cheju Do were taken in early September,
one in a grassy area, and the other two on earthen banks of
road-cuts on the slopes of Halla San. The stomach of one individual
from Cheju Do contained an earthworm. Our largest specimen,
a male having 154 ventrals and 68 subcaudals, measured 508
(380 + 128).</p>

<p>The subcaudal counts of 68 (KU 38861) and 69 (UMMZ 113461)
on two males from Cheju Do are higher than the maximal count
known for the subspecies <i>ruthveni</i> in Korea, and resemble those
of <i>Amphiesma vibakari vibakari</i> of the Japanese islands. The subcaudals
average 61 (55-65) in <i>ruthveni</i> and 71 (63-83) in <i>vibakari</i><!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The specimen from Cheju Do was captured on September
9 in tall grass near a small stream and was eating a small
<i>Rhabdophis tigrina</i>. The female from near Seoul was obtained
from a Korean on June 10, and was gravid (six eggs, each approximately
35 mm. in length). The length of body measured approximately
550 and the length of incomplete tail 168 in one specimen
(KU 38777, female from 5 mi. ESE Seoul), 540 and 183 in the
other (KU 38778, female from Cheju Do). Respective ventral and
subcaudal counts of the two females are 204, 194, and 74+, 86.</p>

<p>There is some disagreement in the literature as to the proper
generic name of this snake. Differences in dentition between Old
World species (referable to <i>Zamenis</i>) and the American species
(referable to <i>Coluber</i>) are discussed by Bogert and Oliver (1945:365).
The species <i>spinalis</i> has been referred to <i>Coluber</i> by several

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This species seemingly occurs in upland habitats.
Specimens were taken on rocky hillsides, on sparsely wooded hillsides,
and in cultivated fields. November 21 was the latest date of
capture of an active individual (UMMZ 113451), the head of which
was seen many times prior to capture protruding from a hole beneath
the concrete floor of a building. A female (KU 38855),
measuring 915 (775 + 140) in total length, and obtained on June
13, contained nine eggs (32 mm. long). One juvenile had eaten a
half-grown house mouse, <i>Mus musculus</i>; the stomach of a male contained
three mice, one a striped field mouse, <i>Apodemus agrarius</i>,
the other two probably also of that species but too far digested for
certain identification. Eggs probably hatch in late summer. A
young of the year (length of body, 340) was captured on September
30; another juvenile (length of body, 285) was obtained in May.</p>

<p>Our largest male (KU 40123) measured 904 (719 + 185) in total
length. Ventrals and subcaudals of six females averaged 205.8
(198-211) and 62.2 (55-69), respectively, whereas corresponding
counts of four males averaged 196.8 (190-214), and 71.0 (69-74).
Each of nine specimens had dorsal scales in 23-25-19 rows except
one (UMMZ 113451), which had 23-25-23 rows.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>E. rufodorsata</i> was commonly observed and collected
on barren hillsides, on country roads, in rice fields, and along drain<!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>age
ditches and small streams. One was found sunning outstretched
on a road. Two individuals were trapped in cement-walled pits at
the Seoul City Water Works. On <a name="April_5" id="April_5"></a>April 5, five snakes of this species
with one <i>Rhabdophis tigrina</i> and one <i>Agkistrodon halys</i>, all partly
caked with earth, were found sunning in a shallow depression on
the side of a Korean burial mound, which was presumably a hibernaculum.
Aside from one juvenile, four of the <i>E. rufodorsata</i> were
of approximately the same size, having bodies ranging in length
from 385 to 455.</p>

<p>Copulation was observed on April 25 (male, KU 38811, length of
body, 400, and female, KU 38812, length of body, 565), and on
May 4 (female, KU 38816, length of body, 620). Eggs doubtless
hatch at various times in summer. One of five snakes obtained on
April 5 (<a href="#April_5">see above</a>) measured 310 (250 + 60) in total length.
Another juvenile (KU 38828), obtained on October 18, was 478
(385 + 93) long, and our smallest specimen of this species (KU
38821), captured on June 26, measured 275 (230 + 45).</p>

<p>The stomachs of two snakes each contained a <i>Rana nigromaculata</i>;
another individual had eaten a <i>Hyla arborea</i>, and a fourth
specimen had eaten a small fish. One specimen was parasitized
by a cestode.</p>

<p>The largest female from our series (KU 38816) measured 740
(620 + 120), and the largest male (KU 38813), 595 (475 + 120).
Respective ventral and subcaudal counts of 13 males averaged
170.5 (167-174) and 60.0 (56-63), ventrals of 12 females averaged
178.3 (169-182), and subcaudals of 11 averaged 51.0 (46-56).</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Individuals were observed or taken on dry, scrubby
hillsides and in grassy upland areas. One of the three snakes from
the Central National Forest was captured on a steep, forested hillside
among granite outcroppings; another was obtained there along
a stream bank and had eaten three bats, <i>Murina aurata</i> (see Jones,
1960:265), and one mouse, <i>Apodemus</i> sp. (tail only found). P. M.
Youngman reported (personal communication) finding a rat (<i>Rattus</i>
sp.) in the stomach of one individual. A female (KU 38830, length<!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of body, 1180) that was obtained on June 2 contained 17 eggs, each
approximately 32 mm. long. The ventrals of two females numbered
223 and 229, and the subcaudals of the latter 70. Ventrals and
subcaudals of five males were, respectively, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216,
and 71, 75, 75, 69, 75.</p>

<p>The coloration and pattern of our seven specimens are of interest
in view of the probable intergradation between <i>E. s. anomala</i> and
<i>E. s. schrencki</i> in northern Korea (see comments by Shannon, 1956:46).
The smallest specimen (KU 38831), having a total length
of 335 (280 + 55), was obtained 4 mi. N P´yong-taek on September
24. It is nearly uniform pale brown (lacks a dorsal pattern) and
additionally is characterized as follows: incomplete pattern on the
head; no black postocular band (pale brown with black posterior
border); ventrolateral extensions of the head pattern that form
longitudinal stripes of white on the third row of scales; a pale
whitish stripe on the sixth and seventh scale rows that extends
posteriorly to the level of the fortieth ventral and that has a narrow
black border (sometimes interrupted); small and indistinct blackish
markings and pale stripes on sides (no higher than sixth row of
scales); underside of the head whitish; and venter grayish, having
blackish margins on the ends of ventrals posteriorly. KU 38831
is unusual and perhaps anomalous in having a pattern that does not
conform to the juvenile pattern of either subspecies.</p>

<p>A female (KU 38830), having a total length of 1390 (1180 + 210),
from 5 mi. ESE Seoul conforms to descriptions of <i>anomala</i> in being
uniformly pale brown above and in having indistinct dark smudges
on the sides; the ventral surface is whitish having indistinct dark
smudges, brown spots at the ends of each ventral, and the posterior
edge of each ventral brown. A male (KU 40125), measuring 1090
(890 + 200) in total length, from 5 mi. E Seoul, is pale brown above
and lacks markings on the anterior part of the body. Indistinct
dark markings occur at midbody, whereas the posterior quarter of
the body and tail have well-defined black bands on a buff background.
The black bands posteriorly are arranged in pairs; each
pair of bands is separated by two and a half to three scales, whereas
the bands of each pair are separated by only one and a half scales.
The ventral surface has an obscure marbled pattern. Our largest
specimen, a male (UMMZ 113454) having a total length of 1488
(1230 + 258), from the Central National Forest, resembles KU
40125, except that pale brown blotches (29 on body, one blackish
on neck) and dark lateral spots occur anteriorly on the body.<!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Another female (KU 38860, body length, 970) from 4&frac12; mi. W
Chip´o-ri, our northernmost locality of record, has a fairly distinct
pattern dorsally. The 30 dark brown, black-edged blotches that
are separated by a buff background are not arranged in pairs (as
in KU 40125); the dorsal blotches sometimes alternate with small
lateral blotches. The ventral surface is marbled throughout.</p>

<p>Two males from the Central National Forest, having total lengths
of 1105 (920 + 185) and 830 (690 + 140), generally resemble one
another in having the head and neck dark brown or blackish and
the anterior part of body dark brown, but discernibly blotched.
The posterior part of the body and tail of each bears well-defined
blotches (dark brown or black) with buffy interspaces; the dorsal
blotches are sometimes arranged in pairs. The ventral surface of
each is marbled throughout. These two males are noteworthy in
that the pattern anteriorly is obscure, but the ground color is dark,
not pale as in the two specimens from the vicinity of Seoul.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
